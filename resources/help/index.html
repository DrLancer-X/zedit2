<a name="Introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    zedit2 is an editor for the 1991 DOS GCS "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZT">ZZT</a>" and
    the 1992 DOS GCS "Super ZZT". While these game creation systems come with their own editors, zedit2 is designed to
    be a tool for power users, presenting the ability to access non-standard features that may be useful to designers
    (e.g. stat stacking, off-board stat placement), as well as productivity features (e.g. mouse drawing, board
    atlassing, image conversion, buffers, gradient fill.)
</p>
<p>
    It is possible (in fact, fairly easy) to create worlds that will crash or freeze the original ZZT with this tool,
    and while some behaviours come with a warning, relatively few actions are prohibited. zedit2 is designed to be a
    tool that can create practically any possible ZZT world, reducing the requirement for manual hex editing to gain
    access to advanced functionality.
</p>
<p>
    This help file will describe many of the available pieces of functionality in zedit2. Note that, when the help file refers
    to specific keystrokes, it is referring to the default keystroke configuration. If you have reconfigured any of
    the keystrokes, references to those will be inaccurate.
</p>

<a name="Editor"></a><h1>Editor overview</h1>
<center><img src="editor.png"></center>
<ol>
    <li><b>Window title</b> - shows the current world being edited and the current board</li>
    <li><b>Menu</b> - provides access to various editing features</li>
    <li><b>Info box</b> - Presents the following information, in order:
        <ul>
            <li>The number of stats on the board, excluding the player</li>
            <li>The X and Y position of the cursor</li>
            <li>The current board's index number and name</li>
            <li>The size of the current board, in bytes (above 20000 is risky in vanilla ZZT and Super ZZT)</li>
            <li>The size of the entire world, in bytes (above 430000 may be risky in vanilla ZZT and Super ZZT)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Under cursor tile info</b> - shows information (colour and type) about the tile that is currently underneath the cursor.
    If there are stats at this location, the box will also show the following stat information for each stat:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Stat ID</b>: The index of this stat. 0 is usually the player.</li>
            <li><b>Cycle</b>: The cycle this stat runs at (a stat at cycle X will usually execute every X frames.)</li>
            <li><b>X-Step</b>: The x-step of this stat.</li>
            <li><b>Y-Step</b>: The y-step of this stat.</li>
            <li><b>Param 1</b>: The first parameter of this stat.</li>
            <li><b>Param 2</b>: The second parameter of this stat.</li>
            <li><b>Param 3</b>: The third parameter of this stat.</li>
            <li><b>Follower</b>: This stat's follower (used by centipedes).</li>
            <li><b>Leader</b>: This stat's leader (used by centipedes).</li>
            <li><b>Instr. Ptr</b>: This current position of the code that this stat is executing. -1 means stopped.</li>
            <li><b>Code length</b>: The length, in bytes, of this stat's ZZT-OOP code.</li>
            <li><b>Under</b>: The colour and type of the tile under this stat.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Buffer tile info</b> - as before, but for the tile currently in the editing buffer. Pressing space will place this tile.</li>
    <li><b>Current mode display</b> - shows the current editing mode:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Editing</b>: The default mode.</li>
            <li><b>Type to place text</b>: Toggled by F2, when printing characters are typed into the editor, text tiles will be written.</li>
            <li><b>Drawing</b>: Toggled by tab, if the cursor is moved with the arrow keys while in this mode, the buffer tile will be placed automatically with each step.</li>
            <li><b>ENTER on other corner</b>: Enabled with Alt-B, when block selection mode is enabled, move the cursor to specify the bounds of the block, and press ENTER to access block actions.</li>
            <li><b>ENTER to place block</b>: After copying or moving a block, press ENTER to place it at the cursor position.</li>
        </ul>
        Messages will also appear here briefly after performing certain actions such as saving, taking screenshots etc.
    </li>
    <li><b>Editing screen</b> - the screen where the current board (or boards, if atlassing is enabled) is shown. The
        bevelled box in the centre is the cursor. If the area is larger than the editing window size, the scroll bars
        can be used to scroll the display around.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Upon starting up Zedit2, you will be presented with a brand new ZZT world. You can create a new Super ZZT world or
    open an existing world through the File menu.
</p>
<p>
    The arrow keys will move the editing cursor around the screen. To move the cursor around in steps of 10, you can
    hold the Alt key down while moving the cursor.
</p>
<p>
    On the left panel in a box titled "Buffer" you will see the current tile you have in your buffer. To place this tile,
    press space. To choose a different tile, press F3 through F10 to open up different menus containing different tiles
    that can be placed. Some tiles will require some configuration before you can place them. Tigers, for example, will
    require you to select an intelligence and firing rate, as well as whether the tiger fires bullets or stars. To
    choose a different colour, press C.
</p>
<p>
    Press enter when the cursor is over a tile to reconfigure it and store it in your buffer. You can also simply store
    the tile by pressing insert. If the tile is already in your buffer and you wish to reconfigure it, press P. If you
    instead want to reconfigure a tile that is on the board without storing it, press Alt-M.
</p>
<p>
    You can perform more advanced editing of a particular tile, including freely setting all stat variables, adding
    stats to a tile that is not normally meant to have them, removing stats from a tile that is normally meant to
    have them and adding multiple stats to a single tile by holding Ctrl when you press enter, P or Alt-M. See the
    <a href="#AdvancedEditor">advanced editor</a> section of the help file for more details.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the mouse for editing. Hold the left mouse button and draw to place tiles. Use the right mouse
    button to store the tile under your mouse position into your buffer. Both of these will also move your cursor to the
    mouse position. You can also move the cursor to the mouse position without placing or storing a tile by pressing
    the middle mouse button. Finally, you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
</p>
<a name="File"></a><h1>File menu actions</h1>
<h2>New ZZT / Super ZZT World</h2>
<p>
    Creates a new ZZT (or Super ZZT) world. This new world will be created with two boards- a board titled 'Title Screen'
    and a board titled 'First board', with the player approximately placed in the centre and surrounded by empties.
</p>
<h2>Open world</h2>
<p>
    Allows you to choose a .ZZT, .SZT or .SAV world to open. Whether the file is ZZT or Super ZZT is discovered by
    analysing the file header.
</p>
<h2>Recent files</h2>
<p>
    Shows the 10 most recent files opened in Zedit2 for quick access.
</p>
<h2>One world at a time</h2>
<p>
    If this option is selected Zedit2 will only be able to open one world at a time and loading or creating a new
    world will close the current one. If this option is not selected you can open up multiple worlds at a time.
</p>
<h2>Save / Save as</h2>
<p>
    Saves the current world to the specified location. If the world has previously been opened or saved, 'Save' will
    automatically resave the file to the same location. If 'Save as' has been selected or the world is a newly created
    one, a file save dialog will be presented allowing you to choose a location and filename.
</p>
<p>
    When saving, Zedit2 will check your world against various limits and may warn you about settings that may cause
    compatibility problems when run in (Super) ZZT. Some limits are hard and Zedit2 will be unable to save your world
    at all if you go past them.
</p>
<h2>Zedit2 settings</h2>
<p>
    Allows the configuration of several aspects of Zedit2. See the <a href="#Zedit2Settings">Zedit2 settings</a>
    section for more information.
</p>
<h2>Close world</h2>
<p>
    This will simply close the current world being edited.
</p>
<a name="World"></a><h1>World menu actions</h1>
<h2>World settings</h2>
<p>
    Here you can configure various options that are global to the world being edited:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Starting board</b>: This is the board the ZZT world will start on when run. In the original ZZT editor
    the starting board is set to whichever board was being edited when the world was saved. In Zedit2, however,
    the board needs to be manually selected here.</li>
    <li><b>World name</b>: This is the 'world name' of this ZZT world. Note that, unless you change this, it will
    be automatically set to the filename you save this world as, minus the file extension. This is used internally
    by ZZT to reload the world after exiting it. Be careful when modifying this.</li>
    <li><b>Health (and other counters)</b>: Sets the starting value for these counters.</li>
    <li><b>Savegame / Locked</b>: In ZZT save files have this 'savegame' byte set automatically. This prevents
    editing by the original editor unless debug mode is on.</li>
    <li><b>Keys</b>: Select which keys the player starts of with here.</li>
    <li><b>Flags</b>: Enter the starting flags (up to 10 in ZZT and 16 in Super ZZT). Note that only flags containing
    only the characters A-Z, 0-9, : and _ can be reference in ZZT-OOP; however, you can set other flags here.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Import world</h2>
<p>
    Opens a file chooser allowing you to select another (Super) ZZT world. All the boards from that world will then be
    appended onto the world you are currently editing.
</p>
<h2>Load charset</h2>
<p>
    Allows you to open either a MegaZeux-format .CHR or FontMania-format .COM file to replace the current character set.
    This character set will also be used when testing worlds if the appropriate configuration options are set.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the loaded character set is not stored in the world format anywhere- if you are working on a world with a
    custom character set, for now you will need to reload it each time you open Zedit2.
</p>
<h2>Load palette</h2>
<p>
    Allows you to open a MegaZeux-format VGA .PAL palette file to replace the current palette.
    This palette will also be used when testing worlds if the appropriate configuration options are set.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the loaded palette is not stored in the world format anywhere- if you are working on a world with a
    custom palette, for now you will need to reload it each time you open Zedit2.
</p>
<h2>Default charset and palette</h2>
<p>
    Resets the current charset and palette back to the ZZT defaults.
</p>
<h2>Blinking</h2>
<p>
    When this is set (the default) Zedit2 will treat colours 128-255 as blinking colours, which is how ZZT has looked
    for the majority of players. Disabling this will cause Zedit2 to treat the blink bit as a high colour bit instead,
    resulting in a set of brighter colours being made available instead. This will be used when testing worlds if the
    appropriate configuration options are set.
</p>
<h2>Test world</h2>
<p>
    This will save a temporary copy of the world and attempt to launch ZZT to play it. You will need to configure
    Zedit2 for your environment under 'Zedit2 Settings' in the 'File' menu before you will be able to use this.
</p>
<a name="Atlas"></a><h2>Atlas</h2>
<center><img src="atlas.png"></center>
<p>
    This toggles board atlassing, which can be a powerful tool for visualising a set of interconnected boards,
    especially in conjunction with the zoom controls. When you enable atlassing, Zedit2 will start from the board you
    are currently editing and expand outwards, connecting to boards via the board exits, then display them all in one
    continuous editing view. Note that boards are not necessarily reciprocally connected, and boards are not always
    connected in a way that makes cartographic sense. As a result, board atlassing may have different results depending
    on which board you started from if the boards are not sensibly connected.
</p>
<p>
    Board atlassing causes many editing features to slightly change in terms of behaviour while it is enabled. For
    example, if you move the cursor into the 'void' between boards and then create a new board, that board will be
    automatically added to the atlas in the location your cursor was. Furthermore, if that location shared borders
    with existing boards (and those boards were not connected to anything else in the direction of the newly-added
    board) those boards will automatically be connected together. This can speed up the creation of large maps.
</p>
<p>
    After an atlas has been created, it will stick around in your current editing session until removed. If you
    change to another board that is not within an atlas, the editing view will switch back to the single board view;
    however, upon changing back to a board that is part of the atlas, the atlas view will come back. In addition, you
    can have multiple separate atlasses created at the same time, if the world contains multiple separate contiguous
    regions of boards.
</p>
<p>
    To remove an atlas, simply switch to a board that is part of an atlas, then choose Atlas from the World menu again
    (or press Ctrl-A).
</p>
<p>
    Note that large altasses may have a serious impact on editing performance. If this is causing problems you might
    find it better to stick with the single-board view while editing your world and only use atlas mode for looking at
    your work afterwards.
</p>
<a name="Board"></a><h1>Board menu actions</h1>
<h2>Board settings</h2>
<p>
    Modifies various per-board settings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Board name</b>: The name of the current board. This is never shown in-game, but is used in ZZT editors to
    help with keeping track of boards.</li>
    <li><b>Max player shots</b>: Maximum number of player bullets that can be on the board at a time. If this is set to 0,
    the player cannot shoot at all. If this is set to another value, the player will not be able to shoot if there are
    at least this many player bullets on the board.</li>
    <li><b>Time limit</b>: The board time limit. When the time limit runs out, the player will lose 10 health. Note that
     the remaining time is not displayed in Super ZZT. It still works, though.</li>
    <li><b>Player entry X/Y</b>: The player's re-entry location, used to keep track of the player's location for the
    purposes of the 'restart if hurt' flag. Can normally be safely left at 0,0.</li>
    <li><b>Camera X/Y</b>: The current location of the player's viewport camera in Super ZZT.</li>
    <li><b>Dark</b>: Whether the board is dark or not. This option is not available in Super ZZT.</li>
    <li><b>Restart if hurt</b>: If this flag is set and the player takes built-in damage (that is, damage from a bullet,
    star, creature, blinkwall or from running out of time), the player will be sent back to the location they entered
    the board on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Board exits</h2>
<p>
    Allows you to select the boards that can be reached from the various board edges. The 'Reciprocated' check boxes
    indicate which of these connections are reciprocated from the connecting board (that is, if board A has an east
    connection to board B and board B has a west connection to board A, they are considered to be reciprocating.) You
    can also check this box to automatically cause the linked board to link the current board back.
</p>
<h2>Switch board</h2>
<p>
    Brings up a list of boards, allowing you to switch to editing another board.
</p>
<h2>Add board</h2>
<p>
    Prompts for a board name, then creates a new board using that name and switches to it.
</p>
<h2>Add boards (*x* grid)</h2>
<p>
    Prompts for a width, height and board name template, then creates width*height boards, all interconnected in a
    grid organisation. This can be used for quickly constructing large world map areas and locations. The board name
    template will have the {x} replaced with the board's X coordinate within this grid (from 1 to width) and the {y}
    replaced with the board's Y coordinate (from 1 to height).
</p>
<p>
    Two additional options are available. The 'Erase player from boards' checkbox will, if selected, pre-remove the
    player (as though the <a href="#ErasePlayer">Erase player from board</a> operation was performed on each board). The 'Open board grid in
    atlas view' will open the newly-constructed grid in an <a href="#Atlas">atlas</a>.
</p>
<h2>Board list</h2>
<center><img src="boardlist.png"></center>
<p>
    This dialog shows a list of all the boards in your currently edited world. From here you can edit the board name,
    player shots, time limit, player re-entry coordinates, camera coordinates, exits, darkness and restart if hurt
    settings en masse.
</p>
<p>
    One or more boards can also be selected in this dialog. While boards are selected, the buttons on the right
    respectively can be used to move the board(s) up or down in the board listing, or delete them. This will
    automatically edit any board exits or passages pointing to the affected board(s). If destructive changes are
    made (virtually guaranteed to happen when deleting a board, but can also happen if rearranging boards causes
    the title screen board to change) the editor will warn you of these changes before prompting you to continue.
</p>
<p>
    Note that passages without a stat (which always lead to the title screen board) will not be altered, and the
    same is true for any stats that become passages later, so this method of rearranging boards is not entirely
    foolproof.
</p>
<h2>Import board</h2>
<p>
    Prompts you to choose a .BRD file to import, loading it and its settings to replace the current board. Note
    that you will not be able to load a Super ZZT .BRD in a ZZT world and vice-versa.
</p>
<h2>Export board</h2>
<p>
    Prompts you to choose a .BRD file to export the current board and its settings to. Note that this will not
    perform any compatibility checks.
</p>
<h2>Stats list</h2>
<center><img src="statlist.png"></center>
<p>
    This dialog shows a list of all the stats and their parameters on the current board. Unlike the board list
    this does not allow you to directly edit the parameters; however, you can use the columns to sort the data
    in order to find things quickly.
</p>
<p>
    You can modify a stat by double-clicking on its entry, or right-clicking
    the entry and selecting 'Modify', or selecting the entry and pressing enter. If you want to access the advanced
    modification screen, select 'Modify (advanced)' or press ctrl-enter instead.
</p>
<p>
    Any stats you select on this screen will also have a blue rectangle drawn around them in the board view, so
    you can use this to find where particular stats are. Another thing this stat display allows you to do is find
    stats that are positioned off-board and modify them, something that cannot be done from the main editor.
</p>
<a name="Edit"></a><h1>Edit menu actions</h1>
<h2>Select colour</h2>
<p>
    This dialog will let you select a colour to change your current buffer tile to. You can use the arrow keys and
    enter to select one, or you can use the mouse to click on a colour. Note that, if your current buffer tile is a
    text element, you will only have a limited palette of colours to choose from. If you wish to change the text
    character, press P or select 'Modify buffer tile' instead.
</p>
<h2>Modify buffer tile</h2>
<p>
    If your current buffer tile has associated configurable properties, this will pop up a dialog prompting you to edit
    it. The nature of this dialog depends on the type of tile selected:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creatures and other stat elements with basic configurable properties will give you a dialog to modify these
    settings, which are usually things like intelligence, firing rate, direction etc.</li>
    <li>Objects will prompt you to select the character to represent them, and then will open up their ZZT-OOP code
    for editing. More information about this dialog is found in the <a href="#CodeEditor">code editor</a> section.</li>
    <li>Scrolls will open up the Code Editor allowing you to edit their contents.</li>
    <li>Passages will prompt you to edit their destinations.</li>
    <li>Text elements will prompt you to select their character.</li>
    <li>Other types without configurable properties will not result in any dialog being opened.</li>
    <li>Finally, any tile with more than one property will cause the <a href="#AdvancedEditor">advanced editor</a> to
    be opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The '(advanced)' form of this option will open up the <a href="#AdvancedEditor">advanced editor</a> for that tile.
</p>
<h2>Modify tile under cursor</h2>
<p>
    Similar to 'Modify buffer tile', but this time, the tile under the cursor is modified instead.
</p>
<h2>Start block operation</h2>
<p>
    Start block operation, more conveniently accessed via the keyboard shortcut (Alt-B), begins the selection of a
    contiguous region of tiles. Upon selecting the block and pressing Enter, a popup will prompt you to select
    one of several block actions:
</p>
<center><img src="block.png"></center>
<ul>
    <li><b>Copy block</b>: Allows you to select a location to paste a copy of this block. Everything within
    the block (tiles, stats) will be duplicated. If a non-clone player is in the block, that player will be
    moved to the new location. Note that 'Copy block' can also be used to transfer regions between worlds-
    just select 'Copy block' in the source world, then switch over to the destination world to paste it.</li>
    <li><b>Copy block (repeated)</b>: Same as 'Copy block', except you can paste the block multiple times. Once
    you are done, press escape to end the operation.</li>
    <li><b>Move block</b>: This will move a region of the board to another location, leaving empty tiles in its
    wake. Note that, providing the move takes place entirely within the one board, the stat order of those stats
    being moved will remain unchanged. Move block cannot be used to move data between worlds, however.</li>
    <li><b>Clear block</b>: This will erase the contents of the selected region, erasing all stats (except the
    player) and replacing all tiles with empties.</li>
    <li><b>Flip block</b>: This will perform a vertical 'flip' of the contents of the block, such that tiles
    that were previously at the top are now at the bottom and vice-versa. Like move, this will not change the
    order of stats providing the entire flip remains within the same board.</li>
    <li><b>Mirror block</b>: Similar to 'Flip block', but horizontal.</li>
    <li><b>Paint block</b>: This will change the colour of every tile in the block to the colour of the buffer
    tile. Note that text elements may only be able to change to an approximation of that colour if the colour
    is not a valid text colour.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    While it is not one of the options listed on the menu, you can also press ctrl-(0-9) to store the currently
    selected block in an extended buffer. See the <a href="#ExtendedBuffers">extended buffers</a> section for more
    detail. You can also do this after choosing 'Copy block' but before pasting the block.
</p>
<h2>Enter text</h2>
<p>
    While in this mode (which can also be accessed by pressing F2), characters typed into the editing window will
    no longer perform their usual keyboard shortcuts, but will instead create text elements of the character typed.
    Pressing enter while in this mode will also move the cursor down 1 tile vertically, and return the horizontal
    position to whatever it was when you started typing, allowing you to type in paragraphs naturally. Press escape
    to leave this mode.
</p>
<p>
    Note that, if your current buffer tile was set to an appropriate text colour (any colour with a white foreground
    except for white on grey), that colour will be used for text. If it is set to an invalid colour, an approximation
    will be used instead.
</p>
<h2>Toggle drawing</h2>
<p>
    While in this mode (which can also be accessed by pressing Tab), moving the cursor around will also place tiles,
    as though you were pressing space after each movement. Press escape to leave this mode.
</p>
<h2>Flood fill</h2>
<p>
    Flood fill, also accessible by pressing F, will take the current buffer tile and attempt to place it to cover all
    identical tiles in a contiguous region. Note that, for the purposes of flood fill, all Empty tiles are considered
    to be identical irrespective of colour, including empties with stats, so be warned.
</p>
<h2>Gradient fill</h2>
<p>
    Similar to flood fill, but opens up a dialog allowing you to perform a special kind of flood. See the
    <a href="#GradientFill">gradient fill</a> section of this help file for more details.
</p>
<h2>Convert image</h2>
<p>
    Prompts you to choose a BMP, GIF, PNG or JPEG image to convert into ZZT. See the
    <a href="#ConvertImage">convert image</a> section of the help file for details.
</p>
<h2>Convert image from clipboard</h2>
<p>
    As before, but will use whatever image is currently in your system clipboard as input, rather than prompting
    you to choose a file on your file system.
</p>
<a name="ErasePlayer"></a><h2>Erase player from board</h2>
<p>
    This operation will replace the current player on the board with whatever tile was under that player and then move
    the player stat to the corner between the top and right board edges (61,0 in ZZT, 97,0 in Super ZZT). This is useful
    for title screens, and occasionally for working on a board's graphical assets without the player getting in the way.
    If the board is going to be used for gameplay, however, the player should be readded to it first. This can be done
    simply by creating a new player (in the F10 menu by default) - note that a player clone will not suffice.
</p>
<h2>Buffer manager</h2>
<p>
    Opens up the extended buffer manager. See the <a href="#ExtendedBuffers">extended buffers</a> section of the help
    file for more information about this.
</p>
<h2>Element menus (F3-F10)</h2>
<p>
    These menus, also available via the associated function key, allow you to select various elements to replace your
    current buffer tile with. These menus are configurable via the <a href="#Zedit2Settings">Zedit2 settings</a> dialog.
</p>
<a name="View"></a><h1>View menu actions</h1>
<h2>Zoom in / out / Reset zoom</h2>
<p>
    These options will zoom the display in, out and back to the default (1:1) zoom level respectively, allowing you to
    get an eagle eye view of a large area (useful with Super ZZT or board atlassing), or alternatively get close up for
    fine editing. You can also scroll the mouse wheel to change the zoom level.
</p>
<h2>Show grid in atlas</h2>
<p>
    When this is selected, in atlas mode, grid lines will be shown between board boundaries. These can be turned off
    to enable a more immersive viewing/editing experience. These grid lines, however, do show some useful functional
    information when it comes to board connectivity:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Thin partially translucent green edges mean that this board is connected to the board it is physically
    next to in the atlas.</li>
    <li>Thick partially translucent red edges mean this board is connected to some other board via this edge. This
    board may appear somewhere else in the atlas, for example.</li>
    <li>Thick opaque white edges mean this board is not connected to anything via this edge.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Show _______</h2>
<p>
    These options, also available via their key combinations (shift-F1 through F5), visually highlight the presence
    of certain element, which may be difficult to see or tell apart from other elements normally:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Show stats</b>: This will visually highlight tiles with an associated stat</li>
    <li><b>Show objects</b>: This will visually highlight all Object elements</li>
    <li><b>Show invisibles</b>: This will reveal invisible walls</li>
    <li><b>Show empties</b>: This will visually highlight all empties</li>
    <li><b>Show fakes</b>: This will visually highlight all fakes</li>
    <li><b>Show empties as text</b>: This will display empties as text characters, using their colour to determine
    the text character to display. This can be useful for revealing erased text characters in ZZT games made with
    the original editor.</li>
    <li><b>Show nothing</b>: This will return the display to normal. You can also return the display to normal if
    currently in a Show _______ mode by selecting that same mode again (either via menu or key combo) or by
    pressing escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take screenshot</h2>
<p>
    This will take a screenshot of the current board (or boards, if atlassing is on) and save it as a PNG image
    somewhere on your file system (usually the directory you launched Zedit2 from). This will not include any of the
    UI or any other visual markup applied by Zedit2, and will always be captured at a 1:1 zoom level.
</p>
<h2>Take screenshot to clipboard</h2>
<p>
    As before, but this will capture the same shot directly into your system clipboard, for pasting directly into
    image editors or other software.
</p>
<a name="Help"></a><h1>Help menu actions</h1>
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>

<!-- ===================================================================================================== -->
<a name="Zedit2Settings"></a><h1>Zedit2 settings</h1>
<p>
    This dialog, available under the 'File' menu, allows you to redefine the functionality of several parts of
    Zedit2.
</p>
<h2>Keystroke configuration</h2>
<p>
    Most of the key combinations used in Zedit2 can be configured here. Simply click on one of the boxes and press
    the desired key combination to change it to that. Note that you will not be able to select a key combination
    that is already in use elsewhere.
</p>
<h2>World testing configuration</h2>
<p>
    You can test the world you are editing in Zedit2 by pressing Alt-T or choosing 'Test world' from the World menu.
    This screen allows you to configure ZZT and Super ZZT for testing purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Note that much of the functionality was designed with asie's <a href="http://zeta.asie.pl/">Zeta</a> emulator in
    mind, and while you may have some success with other emulators like <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">Dosbox</a>,
    or even ZZT game engine recreations, some functionality may be missing.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Start the tested world on the current board</b> - The temporarily world created during testing will have
        its starting board set to the current board if this option is selected. This can make testing a world while
        working on it more efficient.</li>
    <li><b>Test directory</b>: For best results, this should be a directory that:
        <ol>
            <li>Can be written to by Zedit2</li>
            <li>Contains ZZT and your ZZT emulation solution of choice</li>
        </ol>
        A temporary testing world will be saved into this directory and then your emulator will be invoked to run ZZT
        with this testing world. The world will be deleted after exiting ZZT (however, if Zedit2 closes for some other
        reason before ZZT exits, the testing world may be left behind.)
    </li>
    <li><b>Command to run</b>: This is the program that Zedit2 will invoke to test ZZT. It will be invoked from the
        test directory specified above, so it must be reachable from within that directory.</li>
    <li><b>Command parameters</b>: These are command-line parameters that will be passed to the above program
        (before Zedit2 passes in other parameters, such as the filename of the testing world.)</li>
    <li><b>Base name</b>: The name that the temporary testing world will be named after. Note that Zedit2 will
        attempt to append numbers onto the end of this filename if the file already exists. If the base name is
        <tt>__TEST</tt>, the testing world will be named <tt>__TEST.ZZT</tt> (or <tt>__TEST.SZT</tt> in the case of
        Super ZZT). If there is already a file named <tt>__TEST.ZZT</tt> it will be named <tt>__TEST2.ZZT</tt> instead,
        and so on.
    </li>
    <li><b>After ____ milliseconds inject 'P' into the input stream</b>: This is a useful, albeit experimental option
        designed to be used alongside the '-t' command-line argument for Zeta which will skip the K C [enter] prompt at
        the start of ZZT. With this, Zedit2 will attempt to press P on the Zeta window when it pops up, launching you
        directly into the game.</li>
    <li><b>After ____ milliseconds inject 'Enter' into the input stream</b>: This is another experimental option
        designed to be used with the above option when testing Super ZZT worlds. Super ZZT normally launches an
        introductory sequence after the user presses P, which is then terminated by pressing Enter. This will press Enter
        for you, allowing you to immediately jump into your Super ZZT world. (Note that the time delay will happen
        <i>after</i> P is pressed by the above option, assuming it is selected.</li>
    <li><b>Use charset and palette, if modified</b>: If a non-default charset or palette is currenty loaded, Zedit2
        will save the charset and/or palette to files in the test directory and pass in <tt>-l palette:pal:__TEST.PAL</tt>
        and <tt>-l charset:chr:__TEST.CHR</tt> command-line parameters (with the filename changed to whatever the
        configured base name is). This will work in Zeta but is unlikely to work in other emulators.</li>
    <li><b>If blinking is disabled, pass -b</b>: If Blinking has been turned off (the option is found in the World
        menu), this will pass the -b command-line option, which in Zeta will disable blinking and treat the blink bit as
        a high colour bit instead. Again, unlikely to work in other emulators.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code editor configuration</h2>
<p>
    This screen allows you to configure the colours used in the ZZT-OOP editor. You can also configure whether newline
    characters are automatically added to the end of objects you edit (as omitting these can occasionally result in
    unexpected behaviour.)
</p>
<h2>Element menu configuration</h2>
<p>
    Here you can configure the contents of the F3-F10 menus by dragging elements from one menu to another and renaming
    the menus as you please. You can also choose some presets inspired by the original (Super) ZZT editor and <a href="https://github.com/cknave/kevedit">KevEdit</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Note that both elements from ZZT and Super ZZT will appear on this configuration screen, but they will only appear
    in the menus if supported by the current world being edited.
</p>
<a name="AdvancedEditor"></a><h1>The advanced editor</h1>
<center><img src="advancededitor.png"></center>
<p>
    The advanced editor allows you to make nonstandard modifications to a tile's contents. It is divided into two
    panels; the 'Edit tile' panel and the 'Edit stats' panel. The 'Edit tile' panel simply allows you to change the
    type and colour of this tile. You can even access types that have no meaning in ZZT (these may cause your game
    to crash when displayed.)
</p>
<p>
    The 'Edit stats' panel will only be displayed if this tile has stats. You can add a stat to a statless tile by
    clicking the 'Add stat' button. From here you can select which stat you are editing on the list on the left
    (in the case of multiple stats associated with one tile) and edit the stat parameters on the right. Most of these
    are straightforward, but there are a couple of things that stand out:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Location</b>: This will change the location, on the board, of this stat. After you apply this change
    to the board, the stat will move from it. Note that this will change the stat's location, not the tile's. You
    can make use of this to do things like place stats in off-board locations.</li>
    <li><b>Order</b>: The order in which stats execute is important in ZZT, and this is a special stat parameter
    that is only used in Zedit2, which influences the order of stats. Stats with a lower Order value will be sorted
    before stats with a higher Order. Note that other editors, including ZZT itself, will erase this setting. This
    setting also has a different behaviour if the 'Set ID' flag is enabled. Note that stat 0 (the player) will not
    be reordered irrespective of the value of this parameter.</li>
    <li><b>Follower / Leader</b>: You can click the magnifying glass to select a stat from the stat list.</li>
    <li><b>Instr. Ptr</b>: The code position in the title bar of the code editor can be used as a reference
    for editing this value. You can also set it to -1 to 'pre-stop' an object, allowing you to omit a starting
    <tt>#end</tt> command.</li>
    <li><b>Edit code</b>: This will allow you to edit the code attached to this stat. Notably, this will even
    allow you to add code to stats that do not normally have any use for it.</li>
    <li><b>Bind</b>: This will prompt you to select a stat from the stat list. The stat will then be bound to
    that stat's code. This is a powerful tool for saving memory, but can be risky when it comes to zap/restore.</li>
    <li><b>Autobind</b>: This enables 'autobind' mode for this stat. A stat with autobind will automatically bind
    with another stat that contains identical code. This can make it easier to quickly bind many identical stats.</li>
    <li><b>Set ID</b>: When this flag is enabled, the Order value is treated as an absolute stat number (useful in
    certain situations, like when dealing with duplicator teleportation or non-1 cycle values.) If the stat number
    cannot be obtained, Zedit2 will attempt to give the stat a number close to it.</li>
    <li><b>Player</b>: The stat 0 player has special treatment in ZZT. This flag identifies this stat as being stat 0.</li>
</ul>
<a name="CodeEditor"></a><h1>The code editor</h1>
<center><img src="codeeditor.png"></center>
<p>
    This editor is launched whenever you attempt to edit the code attached to a stat. It contains some basic editing
    features that you would expect in a text editor, in addition to the ability to preview ZZT <tt>#play</tt>
    statements - place the text cursor at the start of the #play line or lines and press Alt-T.
</p>
<p>
    The editor will attempt to warn you about syntactically incorrect ZZT-OOP or otherwise risky practices by
    displaying text in a warning colour. In that event, you can hold the mouse over the relevant piece of code to see
    a description of the issue.
</p>
<p>
    There are a couple of other areas where holding the mouse over a section of code will display something useful:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Holding the mouse over a <tt>#char</tt> statement will reveal the character corresponding to the value used.</li>
    <li>Holding the mouse over a <tt>#play</tt> statement will reveal the number of <tt>/i</tt>s that a Cycle 1
    object will need to wait, on ZZT's default speed, to equal the amount of time that <tt>#play</tt> sequence
    will take.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that you can press F3 while in the code editor to insert a text character into your code. You might also
    find this dialog useful for finding the character # of any character, for use with the <tt>#char</tt> command.
</p>
<a name="ExtendedBuffers"></a><h1>Extended buffers</h1>
<center><img src="buffermanager.png"></center>
<p>
    In addition to the standard editor buffer, which contains one tile and does not persist if Zedit2 is closed,
    there are a set of extended buffers that can contain individual tiles and blocks of tiles. As long as Zedit2 is
    closed normally, these buffers will persist along with Zedit2's configuration and can therefore be used to build
    up a library of useful objects, patterns, fades etc.
</p>
<p>
    You can press Ctrl-(0-9) to store your current buffer tile in one of ten extended buffers. Once you have a tile
    stored in this way, you can retrieve it by pressing 0-9. It will then become your new current buffer tile.
</p>
<p>
    The extended buffer can be used for storing blocks of tiles as well. While selecting or pasting a block, you can
    press Ctrl-(0-9). This will store the block in that buffer. When you press 0-9, if there is a block larger than
    1x1 in that extended buffer, the editor will switch into block paste mode and you will be able to place it by
    pressing enter.
</p>
<p>
    You can preview, access and manipulate the contents of your extended buffers by bringing up the buffer manager
    (Ctrl-B or under the 'Edit' menu). You can then see the contents of each buffer, as well as move them around by
    clicking and dragging, and retrieve them (as though you pressed the key associated with that buffer) by clicking
    on them.
</p>
<p>
    Although the first 10 extended buffers are special as they can be accessed through keystrokes, additional extended
    buffers are available from the buffer manager. You can set their contents by copying something to one of the first
    10 buffers using the appropriate key combo, then moving it to another slot in the buffer manager.
</p>
<p>
    Note that buffers with certain properties will be available as patterns for the
    <a href="#GradientFill">gradient fill</a> command.
</p>
<a name="GradientFill"></a><h1>Gradient fill</h1>
<center><img src="gradientfill.png"></center>
<p>
    This feature works similarly to flood fill in how it determines the region to cover, but can be configured to fill
    that region in special ways. This is a productivity tool designed to help create certain effects that are often
    seen in ZZT games but are time-consuming to create by hand.
</p>
<p>
    The basic principle here is that you choose a gradient and gradient style and configure it how you please. The
    flood-filled region will then be filled in using this gradient. The editing window will update as you change the
    fill settings, so you can preview what the change will look like before you make it.
</p>
<h2>Gradient styles</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Linear</b>: A linear gradient drawn along the angle of your choice.</li>
    <li><b>Box</b>: Each tile in a box gradient will be drawn based on its Manhatten distance from the defined centre point.</li>
    <li><b>Radial</b>: Same as a box gradient, but with Euclidean distance, resulting in a circular gradient.</li>
    <li><b>Conical</b>: Tiles are drawn based on their angle away from the centre point instead of distance.</li>
    <li><b>Slime</b>: Tiles are drawn based on their distance from the edges of the flood-fill. Useful for creating pools, cave walls etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gradient</h2>
<p>
    Here you can select the gradient that will be used for this fill. Seven default gradients are provided, but if these
    are not sufficient, you can create additional gradients by storing a block that is more than 1 tile wide and
    exactly 1 tile high into an <a href="#ExtendedBuffers">extended buffer</a>. All blocks meeting this requirement will
    be available for selection from the gradient drop-down box.
</p>
<h2>Gradient parameters</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Start</b>: How far along in the gradient pattern does the gradient being drawn actually start from. This is
    normalised such that 0 is the start of the gradient pattern and 1 is the end. If you set this to a value larger
    than 0, the start of the gradient will be skipped. If you set this to a value smaller than 0, the start of the
    gradient will effectively be repeated, based on how far into the negatives this goes.</li>
    <li><b>Finish</b>: How far along the pattern does the gradient go before ending. If you set this to less than 1, the
    gradient will end early and the latter parts of the pattern will be unused. If you set this to larger than 1, the
    last tile in the pattern will be repeated, dependng on how high you set it. Note that, if the 'Start' value is
    lower than the 'Finish' value, 'Finish' will be treated as 'Start' and vice-versa. If you want to reverse the
    pattern, use the Invert setting.</li>
    <li><b>Horizontal / Vertical</b>: The centre point, relative to the total area being flood-filled. This position
    is used by the Box, Radial and Conical gradients.</li>
    <li><b>Angle</b>: For linear gradients, the angle that this gradient is drawn alongside. For conical gradients,
    this angle is used to offset the angle the gradient is drawn at.</li>
    <li><b>Repeats</b>: This setting causes the gradient pattern to repeat the specified number of times. Note that, on each
    odd-numbered repeat, the gradient pattern will be reversed.</li>
    <li><b>X/Y-Weight</b>: Used by the Slime gradient, this affects how much it "costs" for the fill to travel
    horizontally vs vertically. The default settings of 0.8 and 1.4 are designed to counteract the rectangular shape of
    the ZZT tiles. If you are working in Super ZZT you may prefer weights of 1.6 and 1.4, to reflect the wider tiles.</li>
    <li><b>Diffusion</b>: Adds a small amount of random variance to the gradient, making it 'noisy'. This is a setting
    that should probably be fine-tuned after you have chosen all your other flood-fill parameters, but can create
    visually powerful results.</li>
    <li><b>Invert</b>: If checked, the gradient pattern is treated as though it were reversed.</li>
</ul>
<a name="ConvertImage"></a><h1>Convert image</h1>
<center><img src="convertimage.png"></center>
<p>
    This is another productivity tool, designed to take external bitmap images and convert them into a rough visual
    approximation in ZZT, using ZZT elements as graphical tiles.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this feature is highly experimental and may require significant tuning to produce decent results, if it
    is possible to produce decent results at all. It may be best to use this as a base for doing manual design work on.
</p>
<p>
    You can access this tool from the 'Convert image' and 'Convert image from clipboard' options in the 'Edit' menu.
    After specifying an image, it will be loaded into the left screen in the convert image dialog. A preview of the
    current conversion will be displayed in the right screen.
</p>
<p>
    The converter is affected by the currently loaded palette and charset, as well as the current setting of the 'Blink'
    parameter. These will all be used in the optimisation process, so it is recommended that, if you are using a custom
    charset/palette/blink setting, that you have them loaded before you convert your images. Colours are compared in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> colour space with an assumption that the
    palette is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> colour space, so this assumption may also affect
    the outcome of the conversion.
</p>
<h2>Left, right, top, bottom</h2>
<p>
    These values are used to specify the bounds of the source image. You can
    tweak these to clip the image prior to conversion.
</p>
<h2>Macroblock width and height</h2>
<p>
    These are important values when it comes to influencing the quality of the
    conversion, but their use is subtle. These values are the size of the blocks used for comparing the results
    of the conversion to the original image for the purposes of optimising output.
</p>
<p>
    8x14, for example, will result  in entire characters being compared at a time. What will happen in that case is
    that, in the output image, the contents of an entire tile will be averaged down to one pixel. The respective area
    in the input image will also be averaged down to a single pixel and the two pixels will be compared for
    similarity. The element and colour combination that result in the closest pixel will then be chosen to represent
    that block of graphical data.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose a smaller macroblock size, however, this will result in each char turning into multiple pixels, which
    will then be compared against pixels created from the same-sized macroblocks in the original image. This can go
    all the way down to 1x1 macroblocks, which result in individual pixels being compared. The converter will compare
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_error">RMSE</a> of different tile choices to choose the
    most optimal tile to represent that area of the image.
</p>
<p>
    Macroblock sizes can only be provided in factors of the character size (8x14). This means the width of a macroblock
    can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8 and the height can only be 1, 2, 7 or 14. The macroblock size setting has the following
    implications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Larger macroblocks result in faster conversion due to fewer comparisons needing to be made.</li>
    <li>The largest macroblock size (8x14) usually only results in visually pleasing results when only solid
    and dither characters are in use. This is because the only information used by the converter is the % of pixels
    in the character that are set. Allowing the use of other elements results in something that looks like it came
    out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAlib">AAlib</a>, which is probably not desirable unless you want
    that particular effect.</li>
    <li>The smallest macroblock size (1x1) also frequently results in less-than-ideal results, owing to the fact that
    individual comparison of pixels does not manage any kind of visual approximation, which means that dither
    characters, for example, are highly unlikely to be used despite the fact that they are applicable in a lot of
    cases. However, 1x1 macroblocks do have one particular edge case in which they are useful: If you have a perfect
    (that is, no resizing, filtering or compression artifacts) screenshot of a ZZT board, you should be able to
    perfectly recreate it using a 1x1 macroblock size, as this will favour exact matches for chars over anything
    else. As long as your selected elements and 'Max Stats' value are sufficient for representing the characters used,
    you can exactly recreate the screenshot in ZZT.</li>
    <li>It is recommended that you try different settings. Often 2x2 is a reasonable compromise between precision and
    accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output width and height</h2>
<p>
    This is the width and height, in chars, of the output image. Note that the input image will be scaled, if necessary,
    to match this width and height.
</p>
<h2>Element use</h2>
<p>
    Here you can select which ZZT elements the converter will use. Generally speaking, the more options you give it, the
    better it will be able to approximate your image- however, if you want to avoid certain elements due to how you plan
    on using the result, or because those elements visually result in something you do not like, you can turn those off.
</p>
<p>
    At the bottom of the selection are a number of buttons for preset element configurations.
    'Select all' and 'Deselect all' are self-explanatory. 'Dither only' will select only Empty, Water (Floor in Super
    ZZT), Solid, Normal and Breakable. 'All gfx' will select all of the graphically useful tile types, avoiding a few
    tiles that have issues (e.g. they change colours or chars during display, or they aren't handled properly by the
    converter).
</p>
<p>
    Note that all the elements used here are <b>statless</b>, and they will therefore not contribute towards the board
    stat limit. If you want to make use of stats, that is handled separately, though the 'Max Stats' parameter.
</p>
<p>
    The performance of the converter will be affected by the number of elements you have selected (unless the 'Max
    Stats' parameter is set to something other than 0), as the more elements the optimiser has to choose from, the more
    work it will need to do.
</p>
<p>
    Some elements are not recommended, or some with some caveats:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Transporter, Object</b>: Without stats these elements are invisible, so there is no point in using them.</li>
    <li><b>Star, Clockwise, Counter, SpinningGun</b>: These elements use inconsistent characters (and in the case of
    star, inconsistent colours) which will change as parts of the screen get refreshed, and are typically not suitable
    for ZZT art.</li>
    <li><b>Line, Web</b>: These elements are not handled properly by the converter- the converter, which only operates
    on one tile at a time, is unable to optimise based on tiles that are affected by surrounding tiles as these are.</li>
    <li><b>Scroll, blinking text (and possibly others)</b>: These will cause ZZT to crash or behave oddly if touched,
    so they should only be used if well out of reach of the player. Other elements may also have undesirable effects if
    touched as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Max stats</h2>
<p>
    This setting allows you to set the maximum amount of stat objects that will be used to allow the converter to
    better approximate certain characters. Stats count towards the board total and will also result in increased memory
    use compared to regular elements, so it is recommended that these be used sparingly.
</p>
<p>
    The converter will always use objects for this setting, irrespective of the 'element use' settings. This is because
    objects are the most optimal way of representing any char/colour pair with a single stat.
</p>
<p>
    If 'Max Stats' is set to anything other than 0, conversion performance will be seriously reduced. This is due to the
    way the conversion process works. Rather than simply finding the best element/colour combination of every tile, the
    converter will also find the best char/colour combination. After all of the tiles have been converted to one of the
    selected elements, the converter will then choose the tile that would result in the greatest reduction of RMSE if it
    were replaced with an object. The converter will continue replacing the tiles that would result in the most
    improvement until either it exhausts the 'Max Stats' value or none of the remaining tiles can be improved. As a
    result, there is a negligible performance penalty from increasing the 'Max Stats' past 1- most of the performance is
    lost from the initial global optimisation. It is therefore suggested that you tune the other parameters with 'Max
    stats' set to 0, and when you are happy with that, put in the maximum number of stats you are happy to expend.
</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>
    The image converter is multithreaded and will benefit from additional CPU cores, due to the optimisation happening
    character at a time. This does, however, mean that the converter is unable to consider how characters can affect the
    visual perception of neighbouring characters (the principle behind error diffusion and many other quantisation
    approaches), which means there are bounds on how good the results can be. Note that you can interrupt the conversion
    by changing settings at any time- you do not need to wait for the conversion to complete.
</p>
<p>
    After the conversion is done and you are happy with it, clicking the 'OK' button will result in the convert image
    dialog disappearing and you will be able to place the newly-converted image on the board by pressing enter. You can
    also store the image in an extended buffer by pressing Ctrl-(0-9).

<ul>
    <li>
        Holding shift while pressing a directional arrow key will switch boards to the board linked in that direction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Holding ctrl-shift while pressing a directional arrow will do the same thing, unless there is no board linked in
        that direction. In that event, the 'Add new board' dialog will pop up, and the newly created board will
        automatically be reciprocally linked to the board you were on before in that direction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Home and end keys can be used to quickly jump to the top-left and bottom-right of the board. This also works
        in the colour and character select screens.
    </li>
    <li>
        When in the character selection screen (for selecting an object or text element's char), you can type in
        a character to jump to it immediately.
    </li>
</ul>
<a name="FutureWork"></a><h1>Future work</h1>
<p>
    This is a small wish list for features to go into future versions of Zedit2. Some of these are small things that
    would be easy to implement but are low priority. Others are 'nice to have's that may have significant issues
    getting in the way of their implementation.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Support for loading and saving of MZM files. This is a file format from
        <a href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/">MegaZeux</a> that is suitable for holding blocks of tiles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to configure the screenshot save location and filename. These are already configurable, but the
        configuration screen doesn't have settings for them yet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some form of support for editing layers. This is a feature Dr Dos has mentioned as a useful feature before- it's
        just a matter of scoping exactly what is required here.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some ability to configure the limits shown for various warnings. With the
        <a href="https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt">Reconstruction of ZZT</a>, modified versions and
        source ports that do not have the same limits as traditional ZZT may become relevant.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some ability to store the loaded palette/charset/blink setting in the ZZT file itself so these do not need to be
        loaded each time.
    </li>
    <li>
        A feature that will take screenshots of every board in a world automatically and store them in a directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some advanced world querying tools, perhaps similar to those used in the
        <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/">Museum</a> (e.g. being able to search every object's code would be very
        useful for development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some advanced world-modifying tools. A global object size optimiser (rewrite labels and flags to be shorter,
        remove unnecessary line breaks and comments, replace #end with \0 etc.) would be nice, for example.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some kind of external plugin or scripting language support. There are a lot of things that are just much easier
        to do programmatically when designing a ZZT world and this may be one way of supporting these.
    </li>
    <li>
        Being able to flood-fill 2D patterns would be nice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for some kind of non-standard file format...
        <ul>
            <li>...that would support world that can't be stored in the ZZT file format (e.g. objects with 100kb of
            code, more than 255 boards etc.)</li>
            <li>...that are human-readable or easier to create tools for, e.g. JSON, XML.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for a full-screen editing mode that is better than simply maximising the window.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to import/export files form the code editor. Currently you can copy and paste the text between programs,
        but as Zedit2 works in CP437-converted-to-Unicode compatibility may not be the best.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the currently loaded character set in the code editor and other places where the CP437 font is used. It
        seems that only vector fonts are supported by Swing so there may not be any easy way of doing this, but it would
        be nice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve the image converter to better consider the global effect of tiles on the visual perception of the image.
        At the moment it essentially does a local optimisation per tile.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve performance, especially of general editing while in atlas mode (especially when zoomed out so large
        portions of the screen are visible at once.)
    </li>
    <li>
        There are some hugely inefficient things  Zedit2 does, such as resorting all stats whenever anything relating to
        a stat is changed, but these have mostly been ignored as they do not appear to have a large contribution to
        Zedit2's performance problems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Better custom keystroke handling. At the moment only one key combo can be associated with each command and each
        command can only have one key combo associated with it. This should basically all be handled in a more
        intelligent way.
    </li>
    <li>
        The config file should have its entries sorted so that the file is human-editable.
    </li>
    <li>
        This help file should have search support.
    </li>

<a name="Changelog"></a><h1>Changelog</h1>
<h2>v0.39</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug where stat stacks are displayed using their last stat instead of their first. (thanks authorblues.)</li>
    <li>Editing the code of a stat that exists only in the buffer is now impossible - this is to prevent loss of information. A code editor will not pop up when pressing P to edit an object/scroll, and only the code viewer will be available from the advanced editor. (thanks RT-55J.)</li>
    <li>Closing the tile editor with the escape key when the tile has been modified will show an 'Are you sure?' dialog to prevent accidental loss of information. (thanks authorblues.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.38</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Released under the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.37</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Now always prompts when attempting to close a world, whether it needs saving or not. There is a new PROMPT_ON_CLOSE config option (currently not exposed via Settings) that can be set to false to disable this behaviour. (thanks DeadPhrog.)</li>
    <li>ZZT high score files with the same name as the test world (with a .HI extension for ZZT or a .HGS extension for Super ZZT) will be deleted when the test world is.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.36</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added warning before using blinking text / grey text and other elements in that range that call uninitialised function pointers in ZZT (thanks WiL.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.35</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Flood fill now considers statted vs non-statted elements (thanks TheGreenHerring.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.34</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added config option to disable syntax highlighting in the code editor (thanks DarkMatt.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.33</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added 'Import boards' option to Board menu. Allows you to import multiple .BRD files. If the boards are numbered, they
        will be imported to that board #.</li>
    <li>Added 'Export boards' button to the board list. This will export boards, giving them filenames based on their board #s.</li>
    <li>The insert char action in the code editor will now insert a number if the cursor is directly after the text '#char ' (thanks DarkMatt)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.32</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug where indented text not preceded on line by command would have incorrect max length highlighting (thanks CJA.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.31</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug related to move block / flip block / mirror block operations (thanks DeadPhrog.)</li>
    <li>Possibly(?) fixed bug related to losing window focus? (thanks DeadPhrog.)</li>
    <li>Added command to remove current board from atlas (thanks DeadPhrog.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.30</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pressing space over a tile when you have the same tile in your buffer now deletes it (thanks Anna Anthropy.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.29</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug where clearing a keybind would stop all keybinds from working (thanks DarkMatt.)</li>
    <li>Board name editing field now limits the board name length and shows the current and maximum lengths (thanks DarkMatt.)</li>
    <li>The live preview during image conversion no longer slows the entire process down quite as much as it did. Converting really large images (e.g. massive Super ZZT multi-board atlases) won't be quick, but it is at least a little more feasible now. Also added an option to disable the live preview, which may be useful when converting really big images.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where image conversion default tile types would not be set correctly</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.28</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug introduced by using 'Erase player from board' on board where the player is already erased (thanks TheGreenHerring.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v0.27</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added 'Add boards (*x* grid)' command to editor.</li>

        ZEdit2 on multiple machines. A list of Java system properties can be found
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html" target="_blank" />here</a>.</li>
